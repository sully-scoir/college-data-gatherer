Term Match: "deadline" -> <p> Is there a deadline to apply to Albright? 
Term Match: "deadline" -> <p> Admission at Albright College is rolling, which means you can apply at any time after the completion of your junior year. Summer is a great time to become familiar, or even start an application for admission, and the Common App traditionally opens on August 1. We encourage students to apply during the fall of their senior year of high school. Albright College has extended our enrollment deadline for the class enrolling in the Fall of 2020 to JUNE 1 as a result of the effects of Covid-19 (Coronavirus).
