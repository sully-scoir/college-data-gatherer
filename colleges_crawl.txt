Applicants who choose to apply for Early Decision or Early Action will receive one of three possible decisions: an offer of admission, deferral to Regular Decision, or denied admission. Early Decision is binding, so if offered admission, students admitted for Early Decision must attend Drexel University and withdraw any applications submitted to other schools. Early Action is non-binding, so accepted students have until May 1 to explore their options. Students applying Regular Decision have a later deadline and will receive their decisions by April 1. This decision is also non-binding. Learn more about Early Decision and Early Action admission options.
